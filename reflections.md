# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I came up with an idea for the project, which is a US Capitals quiz. It will display the 3 choices to the player (1 correct answer, and 2 randomly chosen wrong answers). Player will click the response. It will also keep track of how many the player got right and wrong. I quickly fleshed out how the states and capitals will be stored, which will be an array of objects.)
2. begin to build the objects and see how I can display (through the console) the 3 choices.
3. Create initial boilerplate, and start on the logic. Not sure if using an array of objects would be best, or using arrays within arrays would be best to hold this data, and choosing best way to go about this task.
