# Weekend
- [x] What did you achieve over the weekend?
- [x] What are your goals for today?
- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. I came up with an idea for the project, which is a US Capitals quiz. It will display the 3 choices to the player (1 correct answer, and 2 randomly chosen wrong answers). Player will click the response. It will also keep track of how many the player got right and wrong. I quickly fleshed out how the states and capitals will be stored, which will be an array of objects.)
2. begin to build the objects and see how I can display (through the console) the 3 choices.
3. Create initial boilerplate, and start on the logic. Not sure if using an array of objects would be best, or using arrays within arrays would be best to hold this data, and choosing best way to go about this task.

1. Thought of the project I wanted to work on, and created some psuedocode. 
2. Create initial boilerplate document and begin working on the javascript.
3. How randomly sort the array of objects that make up my questions and answers

1. I created the boilerplate document, and began my work on the javascript, which includes the data that will be used as my questions and answers, as well as initial logic
2. Reworked my javascript. The ability to deliver random questions and answers I believe is beyond my current skillset. The examples I found online had static questions and answers in each object, so I had to follow those examples instead. Also made my HTML and CSS to the  and provide a score to the player.
3. Cannot figure out how to provide a score to the player/track the score.

1. The non-code logic is mostly sound, except for how I was attempting to deliver the questions and answers. 
2. Finish the logic in the code, including how to track the score, and clear the screen for each question.
3. None so far.

# Thursday

- [x] Do you have any blockers?
1. Most JS logic complete. Questions are being tracked, countdown for each question has been programmed, and test ends successfully whether the time runs out or player goes through all the questions. Added some style changes as well.
2. Add JS code to calculate the score, and show to the player once they're done. I'd like to also make the page responsive.
3. Not at this time.

2. Present my project as best as possible
3. None.

# Post Project Questions
1. What HTML, CSS, and or JavaScript skills you learned while building your game?
- I finally used flex-direction to make something mobile compatible, as other CSS tricks I tried didn't wor for what I wanted to achieve. I also got comfortable, in general, with using Javascript. The DOM manipulation would be the best skill out of Javascript that I feel really good about learning during this project.
2. What's one topic you want to spend more practice on?
- More javascript in general. I think my biggest hurdle is the "why" use any one thing within Javascript. Little by little, I'm getting better at it, but I just need more practice.
